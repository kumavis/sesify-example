This is an example app using Sesify.

### status
this example is not ready.
this is not currently a good example because autogen does not work on dependencies that are specified via overrides in the browser field.

### setup
autogenerate the config, then run

start
```
npm install
npm link sesify
```

try these two modes. watch the DOM and browser console for feedback.
```
npm start
npm start-unsafe
```

see `sesify-config.js` to see how the endowments are specified
