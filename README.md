This is an example app using Sesify based on https://github.com/mattdesl/browserify-example

### status
this example is not ready.
this is not currently a good example because of the prototype.toString restriction encountered by the `tone` dependency

### setup
autogenerate the config, then run

```
npm install
npm link sesify
npm run sesify-config
npm start
```
